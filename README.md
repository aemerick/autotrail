# segmendation

An application to produce computer-generated hiking and trail running routes
given a series of user-provided contraints, geared towards the avid
hiker / running aiming for longer activities in areas with complex trail
networks. Initial test case is for the Boulder, CO area.

Still very much building this! 

Would ultimately like to sync this with ability to pull Strava run history
to build a ML model to ALSO add in estimated time of completion as (at first)
a property of the recommended trail AND eventually as a constraint 
used when building the trail. But this may need to be addressed after Insight is over.
