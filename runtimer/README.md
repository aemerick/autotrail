Runtimer is a currently on-hold side project meant to scrape 
user activity data from Strava to generate a data-driven ML model
to predict future performance on user-defined routes, given 
past performance on individual activities and Strava segments
given their distances, time, elevation gain / loss, and weather.
Goal is to integrate this with Plan-It to add in time as a constraint,
continuously updating time-to-completion of a route during 
generation depending on its stats.
